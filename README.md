# Roblox Black Hole Simulation
This is my official repository for my small passion project, the Roblox Black Hole Simulation. I created this firstly for myself, but I will expand it into an educational game that can be used in teaching.

**Overview**: A 2D computational model developed in Luau that simulates photon trajectories around a non-rotating, non-charged black hole using symplectic integration.
