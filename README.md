# Roblox Black Hole Simulation
This is my official repository for my small passion project, the Roblox Black Hole Simulation. I created this firstly for myself, but I will expand it into an educational game that can be used in teaching.

**Overview**: A 2D computational model developed in Luau that simulates photon trajectories around a non-rotating, non-charged black hole using symplectic integration.

## Personal Introduction
Hi. I'm **Synapt0**, the mind behind this project. I'm an American-born 18-year-old whose dream is to unite *quantum mechanics* and *relativity*. While that dream may be colossal and most likely extremely tedious, if I want to get even remotely close, I'll have to teach myself as early as I can understand the material. And that's exactly what I'm going to do while also sharing my progress here. So, if you do decide to stay and read through my adventure, thank you.

## Covered Topics
**DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE MANY TOPICS I DON'T FULLY COVER! I APOLOGIZE IF I LEAVE SOME THINGS OPEN-ENDED.**
